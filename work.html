            <h4>Notes:</h4>
            <p class="project-description">
              In college I worked as a life guard at a summer camp. Every week a
              new group of campers would come in. Safety in the pool meant
              learning their names and faces quickly, knowing their swim level,
              tracking how many should be in the pool, who had not shown up, as
              well as who had gone to the restroom and at what time.
              Additionally, I needed to know of medical concerns such as an
              allergy or diabetes. It was a lot to keep track of, and a slip-up
              could create a life or death situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eye-on is the app my younger self needed. It has a photo of every
              child in the pool with a colored border indicating their swim
              level (red, yellow, or green). The restroom icon removes them to
              the restroom list with a time-stamp of when they left. Clicking on
              the name card reveals a "back side" with important medical
              information. Schedule and time info at the top helps with keeping
              track of when it is time to prepare campers to leave for their
              next class.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was my first app where I branched off on my own in using CSS
              and React. My greatest challenge, and the thing I am most proud of
              here, was the challenge of keeping the view uncluttered while
              incorporating all of the necessary information. Originally the
              camper cards were much larger with more text, which I later
              swapped out for icons and color codes. The smaller card size was
              important in order to maximize how many cards are visible at once.

              This project was a fun experiment practicing some new skills. The
              styling uses Sass mixins, variables, and functions. The animations
              are powered by vanilla javascript. There is a mix of regular CSS,
              Flexbox, and Grid that adapts into a responsive design.

            <p class="project-description">
              I once had to help our school secretary with scheduling a week of
              activities at an outdoor camp for approximately 50 students. She
              chose the activities, fit them into time blocks, assigned staff,
              and then printed out a signup sheet for each one. Each evening we
              would spend a couple of hours going through the process of hanging
              up all of the sign-ups by time slot and then walk each student
              through filling up their schedule for the next day. It. was.
              chaos... Some students would forget to sign up, others would
              accidently choose 2 activities during the same time. There were
              last minute changes to be with friends that left a slew of white
              out and cross out marks.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of this project is to make that process easier. Students
              names will display in red until they have filled their schedule.
              Once an activity is chosen for a particular time block, it will
              not be possible to interact with any of the other activity choices
              during that time. Supervising staff will be able to receive a
              clean and easy to read form of their schedule and assigned
              students for the day.
            </p>
            <p>This project currently is designed with HTML, CSS, and React</p>

        <p>
          My dad gave me my first camera when I was five, and I was hooked. Over
          the years I've gone from using a school-issued SLR and a darkroom, to
          DSLR photography and Photoshop. Sometimes it's about breaking down the
          shyness barrier, sometimes its wrangling active toddlers in, sometimes
          its getting the right angle and lighting, but mostly its about
          communicating the emotions of a moment through my lens. Here is just a
          sample of some work I have done for my clients.

            <h3>Centenial Celebration Logo</h3>
            <p>
              I was approached by the Alumni Association of the school I was
              working at previously. They were preparing for their centenial
              celebration and were wanting a logo that would be reflective of
              the school as it changed over the years. The wavy circle is a
              replica of the first logo, the pines are sung about in the school
              song, the bell was a special gift that sits at center campus, and
              the eagle later became the school mascott. In 2016 the school
              suffered a fire, and repairs brought the building to how it looks
              today - with a peaked roof in place of the original flat one. It
              was a fun project to work on, particularly because of the
              challenge of bringing the many different pieces together in a way
              that many generations of students could appreciate.

            <h3>A Unique Graduation Year</h3>
            <p>
              For graduating seniors in 2020, the traditional comencement
              excercises were not an option. Union Springs Academy wished to do
              a virtual graduation ceremony, and requested help in creating a
              cohesive design to use for the many virtual materials. Dispayed
              here is the front of the PDF program available for online guests
              to follow. In addition, similarly themed social media advertising
              and slideshow backgrounds were created. It was an honor to have
              part in making the ceremony as special and meaningful as possible.

            <h3>Community Organization Newsletter</h3>
            <p>
              A local pro-life organization was needing a new person to layout
              and design their 6-page print newsletter. While not personally
              affiliated with the organization, I was happy to help out. Every
              quarter I receive several articles through email, a specific color
              to use, and am told to "work my magic". I have appreciated the
              opportunity to study and grow my skills in layout. Originally I
              started working in Microsoft Publisher, and then due to some
              program constraints as well as the lack of Mac support, I switched
              to Affinity Publisher. Above is a 2-page sample from one of my
              most recent designs.
